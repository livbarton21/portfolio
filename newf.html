heading: The Newfoundland Pub and Restaurant
subHeading:  A school assignment that was given out to practice branding and logo design, we were asked to choose an Ottawa based business that required some updated graphic design work. The Newfoundland Pub and Restaurant is located on Montreal Road and features raving reviews. Unfortunately, their branding did not match their popularity and did not even include a logo. Knowing that their target audience mostly consisted of middle aged to older men, I knew that the logo would need to be modernized but still remain classic and authentic. After exploring various options and designs, I decided on a fisherman style knot that represented not only their nautical background, but also the tight knit atmosphere of the pub.

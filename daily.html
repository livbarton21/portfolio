heading: The Daily Dose Health Foods Cafe
subHeading: When my sister decided to take a year off of school to open her own health foods cafe, I jumped at the chance to take on the position as creative lead. My responsibilities included all things visual from the logo to the interior design and it was such an incredible way to really immerse myself in the branding world. The main objective of the shop was to offer healthy, delicious options while also maintaining an environmentally friendly environment. In addition, we wanted to introduce a trendy, modern vibe to the cafe in order to attract the younger population of our town. With all of this in mind, I created a palette of neutral and earthy tones with lively pops of green.
